# Housekeeping
Your pull request should:

  - Include a description of what your change intends to do
  - Be a child commit of a reasonably recent commit in the master branch
  - Requests need not be a single commit, but should be a linear sequence of commits (i.e.
    no merge commits in your private repository).
  - It is desirable, but not necessary, for the full BatchDafny verification to succeed at
    each commit (see the [README](./blob/master/README.md) for instructions on running BatchDafny),
    but it must succeed for the final commit.
  - Have clear commit messages e.g. "Refactor feature" or "Fix issue"
  - Follow the code conventions described in the [STYLE](./STYLE.md) guidelines
